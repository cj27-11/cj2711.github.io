<h1> Assignment 1 - My Profile </h1>

<h2> Personal Information </h2>
<img src= "my pic.jpg" alt="me in Seattle" style="width:300px;height300px;">
<p> <b>Name:</b> Cameron Morris </p>
<p> <b>Student Number:</b> s3851460 </p>
<p> <b>Email: </b> s3851460@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
<h2> Background Information </h2>
<p> My name is Cameron, I'm 22, I'm an Australian from Sydney. <br /> I graduated High School in 2015 and orignally went to study at Western Sydney University, although I didn't enjoy what i was doing so I went into full time work for 2 years before returning univeristy to study this course.
My favorite sports are Soccer (Football), Basketball and Mixed Martial Arts, I played soccer to a high level and almost had the opportunity to study and play in the USA, I also competed in Karate where I placed 3rd in a national tournament before quitting to focus on soccer more. </p>
<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
<p> My interest in IT comes from a hobby of my computer which I built in 2016, I enjoy playing with my computer, whether its building and rebuilding it, playing games and just talking to friends via things such as Discord.<br /> 
This sparked my interest in learning IT more and I am looking into exploring a career where I can be around computers and doing what I enjoy. <br> 
I chose to come to RMIT as while I was looking at options to return to study I looked at online options and saw that Open Univeristies offered courses at RMIT and when I researched the univeristy I saw that it is well regarded. <br>
I expect to learn many things from my studies based around all things IT, I also hope to learn my passion for what sort of career I might look into doing, as currently I'm not really sure what to do. </p>
<h2> Ideal Job </h2>
<p> My Ideal Job in an IT field would have something to do with another area of study that I really enjoy which is business, a job such as a IT business analyst would be the kind of job that I look towards after studying. <br />
<p><a href="https://ca.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=0ae1651d545d6bdb&tk=1e4100dsvbi8o800&from=serp&vjs=3">Link to job advertisment</a></p>
<p> This job is called IT Business Senior Analyst, and is located in Ontario, Canada, the reason I chose this job is because it combines my IT studies and also a passion for business that I also have. 
The reason I chose a job located in Canada is, I have always wanted to travel to other countries and experience the world, and I have done research into the IT field in Canada and how it's expanding and demand is high, these two factors combined mean that I would look into a job such as this at some point in my career. <br>
The position is one where you are required to use experience and knowledge about technology and translate that into what a business would need and how to implement that. <br> 
The experience needed for this role is stated at 5-8 years in the field, which means this job is one that would come further down the line after spending some time learning the industry, however I would have the degree needed to apply for this job after completing my studies. <br>
The ad talks about having skills in managing tasks, communication, working under pressure to deadlines and have initiative, all of which I have some experience in throughout my working career so far, and would look into having more of by the time the ability to apply for a job such as this comes time. <br>
I plan on obtaining the skills that I don't already have or lack experience in through my studies and work experience with 5 years of developing in the field so I can feel like I am able to apply successfully. </p>
<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
<p> My Results of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test came out to have a very good match with ENTJ and ESTJ, ENTJ shows someone likes to lead and accomplish their vision and ESTJ shows someone likes to organise things and like to get things done <br>
To me these results mean that I like to have a level of control about what im doing and in a team enviroment this can be both good and bad, good in the sense that my team can count on me to lead and organise things, and bad that sometimes it means that I could get carried away with doing it "my way". <br>
It is up to me to make sure I focus on not letting negative aspects of my personality style get in the way of a team environment and making sure that I am able to sit back and let others contribute and have the chance to lead.<br>
For the Learning Test I completed I got the results of being a Tactile learner where I prefer doing things hands-on to learn, for me this means in a team environment I can be the one to test things and help my team with practical applications as it benefits both the team and myself in learning how things work. <br>
Finally for the last test I completed a Career Personality Profiler Test where I got a result saying I am an Innovator/Pragmatist as my work style, which in a team environment means that I like to be efficient and always look for new and good ways to complete the task. <br>
All of these tests combine to tell me that with a team I can be the one to take the lead if needed, work effciently for my team and I can be the one who is testing things to see if they work. <br>

<h2> Project Idea </h2>
<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> The project I have decided to focus on involves Augmented Reality, It is a type of technology that
I would be intrigued with seeing be developed in the future, as i believe that it could open up
many possibilities for the human race in terms of productivity, quality of life and it could open the
door to further innovation that no one has even thought of yet.<br>
The type of Augmented reality that this project focuses on is Virtual Retinal Display (VRD), which is
where low powered lasers shine directly into a persons retina to create images. </p>
<h2> Motivation </h2>
<p>The motivation behind this project comes from what has already been achieved with this
technology and what it could become.<br>
Currently the technology has been studied for the effects it has on Macular Degeneration (MD),
Keratoconus, which are both eye disorders which effect vision, although still in early stages of
development there has been promising signs, in one study (Viirre, Pryor, Nagata, Furness III, 1998,
pg. 252) 5 out of 8 with MD and all the patients with Keratoconus said they felt the images they
saw were better than tests with another system tested and they were able to lines much clearer.
With further development this could be a technology used to counteract eye diseases. </p>
<h2> Description </h2>
<p> The ideal product would be using this display to create images that the user can load images onto
or have a real time feed to display into their own eye for their own needs.
For the hardware needed to display these images one would need a form of glasses or mount to
have the laser on, the user can have this completely customisable to be as inconspicuous as they
want.<br>
There would need to be a relay system that it can be presented on for the eye to make out the
images/video being portrayed.<br>
As this innovation would be for the use of the public and not just people who have eye diseases
there would need to be a form of software that can store and stream data to the relay for the laser
to portray and as this would always be on a person having it physically connected to something
such as a computer wouldn’t be ideal, a potential solution to this could be via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
connecting to a cellular device or network, this would allow a person to input what they need to
see, for example if a person wanted to see a recipe for what they want to cook for dinner they
could type that recipe into their phone and have a checklist they can always see, this would make
it a lot more efficient to shop, as for a more advanced use, military personnel could have it
adapted as a radar system, with the device being connected to their VRD could be a radar fixed
on their location, this would alert them to threats more immediately.<br>
This device also could portray a live feed to the user, someone could have a camera set up to
watch something, such as a camera feed of their front door so if someone rings it they can see
who has rung the doorbell, this eliminates the need of having to open a device and look at the
footage.<br>
As the applications of this device expand there is potential for it to do more, and be less attached
to a mount, for example the device could be innovated into a contact lens, the ability to eventually
get it connected to what you say, such as what currently is available with a Google Home or
Amazon Alexa so someone could say what they want to search for and they display shows the
results, this allows access to information on the go and a lot quicker than currently available.<br></p>
<h2> Skills Required </h2>
<p> As for the skills required for this project, there are little amounts of software development,
however there is a large need for the implementation of the software being used such as the
ability to connect this device with a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signal, technical knowledge of how that
would be capable of setting up onto the relay would be needed for the device, a software
engineer could be capable of helping with a system like that along with a technician who is
capable of physically putting any pieces together that need to be to construct this device.<br>
Getting the physical hardware such as the mount and laser, these in mass production are
relatively inexpensive to create and produce. In regards to the skills that are needed to produce
this item, finding people with the technical knowledge of how to input a signal into the relay
wouldn’t be a challenge as these technologies are already used and are familiar to engineers
around the world, and for the physical side of assembly, if the device is hand made it is as simple
as connecting the device to the mount, this could be done with automation if the mass production
demands it.</p>
<h2> Outcome </h2>
<p>If this innovation did become a future technology the impact on the daily lives of humans could
change completely, in the way that the mobile phone and social media have impacted the way we
live our lives, this would take those innovations and make them easier to access, access them
faster and more on demand, provide multiple uses for any application and help society become
more connected than it already is. <br>
This device also opens up avenues for further innovation with using other future emerging technologies and eventually it could go the way of full cybernetic and
augmented enhancement to make humans even more advanced than we are today.</br> </p>
